	The purpose of Homework 3 is to list at least 3 project ideas.
	
1)My first Idea is related to a cloth hanging mechanism. The setup will change its direction depending upon the direction of sun and it will also give a warning when it suddenly starts raining. 

2)My Second Idea is related to an Energy Mangement System. The device setup will measure the electrical units being consumed and can calculate the price incurred in real time analysis.

3)My Third Idea is to create a "Smart Home", which enables the optimal usage of the devices by remotely controlling them automatically. The appliances will be turned off when human is not present. The devices may be switched ON/OFF depending upon conditions. Let's say fan may be switched ON when the temperature is above a threshold,etc.
